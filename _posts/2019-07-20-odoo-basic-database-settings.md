Welcome to this arabic video tutorial on Odoo Basics, where we will show you how to create a database, configure your settings and manage your activities in Odoo. Odoo is a suite of open source business apps that cover all your company needs: CRM, eCommerce, accounting, inventory, point of sale, project management, and more. Odoo's unique value proposition is to be at the same time very easy to use and fully integrated.

To start using Odoo, you need to create a database. A database is where all your data and settings are stored. You can create a database from the Odoo website or from the Odoo app. To create a database from the website, go to odoo.com and click on the "Start Now" button. You will be asked to enter your email address, a name for your database, and a password. You can also choose the language and country of your database. Then click on "Create Database" and wait for a few seconds while Odoo sets up your database.

To create a database from the app, open the app and tap on the "Create Database" button. You will be asked to enter the same information as on the website. Then tap on "Create Database" and wait for a few seconds while Odoo sets up your database.

Once your database is created, you can access it from any device by logging in with your email and password. You will see the Odoo dashboard, where you can install apps, access modules, and customize your interface.

One of the first things you should do is configure your settings. Settings allow you to adjust various aspects of your Odoo system, such as company information, users, security, email, invoicing, and more. To access settings, click on the gear icon on the top right corner of the dashboard. You will see a list of categories on the left side of the screen. Click on any category to see its options on the right side of the screen. You can change any option by clicking on it and saving your changes.

Another important feature of Odoo is activities. Activities are tasks that you or your team need to do in relation to your business processes. For example, you can create an activity to follow up with a customer, send an invoice, or prepare a quotation. Activities help you keep track of your work and collaborate with your colleagues. To create an activity, go to any module that supports activities, such as CRM, Sales, or Project. Then click on the plus icon on the top right corner of the screen. You will see a form where you can enter the details of your activity, such as type, summary, due date, assigned user, and notes. Then click on "Schedule" to create your activity.

You can view your activities from the dashboard or from any module that supports activities. You can also filter, group, or search for activities by various criteria. To complete an activity, click on it and then click on "Mark as Done". You can also edit or delete an activity by clicking on it and then clicking on the corresponding buttons.
