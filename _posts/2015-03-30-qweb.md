QWeb is the primary templating engine used by Odoo. It is an XML templating engine and used mostly to generate HTML fragments and pages.

1. `<t-set>`: It sets a value to a variable within the template. You can use this variable to store and manipulate data for later use.

Example:
```xml
<t-set name="customer_name" t-value="order.partner_id.name" />
```
In this example, the value of `order.partner_id.name` is assigned to the variable `customer_name`.

2. `<t-esc>`: It renders the content as plain text, escaping any special characters. It is used to display text without interpreting it as HTML.

Example:
```xml
<span><t-esc="customer_name" /></span>
```
In this example, the value of `customer_name` is displayed within a `<span>` element.

3. `<t-if>`: It enables conditional rendering based on a specific condition. The content inside the `<t-if>` block is displayed only if the condition is true.

Example:
```xml
<t-if="order.state == 'draft'">
    <p>This order is in draft state.</p>
</t-if>
```
In this example, the `<p>` element is rendered only if the order's state is 'draft'.

4. `<t-foreach>`: It allows iterating over a collection of items and rendering content for each item.

Example:
```xml
<t-foreach items="order.order_line" t-as="line">
    <p><t-esc="line.product_id.name" /></p>
</t-foreach>
```
In this example, `<p>` elements are rendered for each item in the `order.order_line` collection, displaying the name of each product.

5. `<t-value>`: It outputs the value of an expression or variable.

Example:
```xml
<p>The total amount is: <t-value expr="order.amount_total" /></p>
```
In this example, the value of `order.amount_total` is displayed within the `<p>` element.

6. `<t-att>`: It is used to set the attributes of an HTML tag dynamically. You can assign values to attributes based on variables or expressions.

Example:

```xml

<a href="#" class="button" <t-attf=title="{record.name}">Click</a>

```

In this example, the `href` attribute is set to `#` and the `class` attribute is set to `"button"`. The `title` attribute is dynamically set to the value of the `record.name` variable.
7. `<t-debug>`: It is a debugging tag used to print the value of an expression during template rendering. It is useful for troubleshooting and understanding the template flow.
Example:

```xml

<t-debug value="order.partner_id.name" />

```

In this example, the value of `order.partner_id.name` will be printed in the logs or console during template rendering.

8. `<t-raw>`: It allows you to output raw HTML content as-is, without any escaping. It is useful when you want to include HTML tags within your template.
Example:

```xml

<t-raw>&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an example.</t-raw>

```

In this example, the content within `<t-raw>` is rendered as it is, without escaping the HTML tags. So, the resulting output will be "Important Note: This is an example." with "Important Note:" displayed in bold.
